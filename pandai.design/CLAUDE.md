## Project identity

- **Product:** Pandai — educational platform (Student / Teacher / Parent user roles)
- **Design tool:** Figma
- **AI assistant:** Claude Code (primary) + Claude.ai (planning/audit)
- **Workflow:** Figma MCP → Claude Code → VSCode → engineer handoff

---

## Figma file

| File | Key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Pandai DS 1.5 **(cleanup target)** | `TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f` | Original DS — single source of truth after cleanup |

---

## What was audited on the DS file (TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f)

### Critical issues found
1. **ALL_SCOPES on all 878 variables** — every variable had no scope restriction, polluting all property pickers
2. **All 20 component pages were empty** — components were scattered across Nadia Exploration, Syakila Components, and Zul's Dungeon pages
3. **Zero paint styles and zero effect styles**
4. **Semantic collection had colors only** — no spacing, radius, or typography semantic aliases
5. **Duplicate components across pages** — multiple versions of Button, Badges, Tab Menu with inconsistent naming

### What was working in the source
- 3-tier token architecture: Atomic → Product (per user role) → Semantic (Light/Dark)
- Product collection multi-mode aliases (Student/Teacher/Parent) pointing correctly into Atomic
- Zul's Dungeon had the most complete v1.5 component sets (44 sets, 23 standalones)
- Poppins type system was internally consistent

---

## Variable collections — actual state after Fix 1 + Fix 2

> **Note:** Actual collection names differ from earlier audit estimates. Counts below are from live file read.

#### Primitives (429 vars, 1 mode: Value) — formerly called "Atomic"
- Colors: Grey (50–950), Orange, Red, OG-Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Lime, Teal, Sky, Neon, Green, Slate, Foundation, Vanilla, Minion, Azure, Mustard, Subject/* palettes
- Scale/0–1k: spacing raw values (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 60, 108, 999)
- Corner Radius/xs–circle, pill, pill, lg, xxl, xxxl
- Typeface: Font Family, Font Weight, Font Size (50–900), Line Height (50–800)
- Border Width: xs, sm, md, lg
- Scopes fixed: colors → `FRAME_FILL SHAPE_FILL TEXT_FILL STROKE_COLOR EFFECT_COLOR`, Scale → `GAP WIDTH_HEIGHT PARAGRAPH_SPACING`, Radius → `CORNER_RADIUS`, Font Size → `FONT_SIZE`, Line Height → `LINE_HEIGHT`, Font Family → `FONT_FAMILY`, Font Weight → `FONT_STYLE`

#### Semantic (255 vars + 22 new = 277 vars, 2 modes: Light / Dark)
- Color groups: Text/*, Icon/*, Surface/*, Border/*, Overlay/* — scopes set per group
- **New float aliases added (Fix 2):**
  - `Spacing/component/none–2xl` → aliases into Primitives Scale/*
  - `Spacing/layout/sm–xl` → aliases into Primitives Scale/*
  - `Radius/none–full` → aliases into Primitives Corner Radius/*

#### Product (174 vars, 3 modes: Student / Teacher / Parent)
- Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (50–900), Success, Alert, Warning, Informative, Neutral
- Spacing/space-none → space-3xl, Border Width, Corner Radius, Overlay, Font/* tokens
- ALL_SCOPES removed — correct scopes assigned per type

#### Responsives (if present)
- Check file directly — not loaded during this session

### Text styles — 21 (Poppins)
```
Header/H1 (28px Bold) → Header/H4 (20px Medium)
Title/T1 (18px Bold) → Title/T5 (16px Medium)
Body/B1 (14px SemiBold) → Body/B8 (10px Medium)
Caption/C1 (12px Regular), Caption/C2 (10px Regular)
Caption/Link Reg (14px Regular), Caption/Link Med (14px Medium)
```

### Effect styles — 6
```
Elevation/xs → Elevation/sm → Elevation/md → Elevation/lg → Elevation/xl → Elevation/overlay
```

### Components — 431 across 25 pages
All from Zul's Dungeon. Full v1.5 coverage including:
- Button (3 sets: Button 1.5, Button Icon 1.5, Spinner 1.5)
- Button Group (2 sets: Parts + full group)
- Navigation Bar (7 sets + standalones: Navbar, Navbar Mobile, Learn Menu, Menu BG, etc.)
- Input Field (Input Field 1.5 + Input Group 1.5)
- Text Area, Dropdown (Parts + List + Tag), Accordion
- Checkbox, Radio Button, Toggle
- Avatar (Avatar 1.5 + Avatar Stacked 1.5)
- Badges (Pill + Subject + Label + Icon + Subject for Table)
- Alerts, Breadcrumb, Tab Bar (Parts + 1.5 + Var1)
- Divider, Modal (Alerts + Selection), Carousel (+ Parts)
- Pagination, Tooltip (+ BG Parts)
- Cards (Quiz Card, Quick Notes, Footer, Class Card, Primary, Practice, Reward)
- Progress Bar, Slider (+ Progress Slider with Icon)
- Table (full set: Cell, Cell Parts, Body Cell/Row, Heading Cell/Row, Table 1.5, Column, Row, Slot, etc.)
- Link

**2 components NOT yet on their pages:**
- `Button - Dropdown - 1.5` → should go in **Dropdown** page
- `Quiz Card - 1.5` → should go in **Cards** page
- Fix: publish these in source library OR manually copy-paste into the correct pages

## Figma MCP setup for Claude Code

```bash
# Install Figma plugin (recommended — remote MCP)
claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official

# OR desktop MCP (if using Figma Desktop app)
claude mcp add --transport http figma-desktop http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
```

### Required Claude Code prompt flow for any Figma-driven component
```
1. get_design_context   → structured React + Tailwind representation
2. get_variable_defs    → extract token names used on the node
3. get_screenshot       → visual reference
4. Implement using local token system
5. Validate against screenshot
```

## CLAUDE.md starter (paste into project root)

```markdown
# Pandai Frontend — Claude Code Rules

## Files
Design system: https://www.figma.com/design/TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f

## Design system rules
- NEVER use hardcoded hex colors — use CSS variables: var(--pd-color-*)
- NEVER use hardcoded px spacing — use spacing tokens: var(--pd-spacing-*)
- NEVER create new components if a DS equivalent exists
- Always check /src/components before building new UI

## Token prefix
All exported CSS variables use prefix: --pd-

## Token collections
- Atomic: raw values (Foundation, Grey, OG Green, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Teal, Slate, Spacing, Radius)
- Semantic: aliased tokens with Light/Dark modes (Text, Surface, Border, Icon, Spacing, Radius)
- Product: role-based colors with Student/Teacher/Parent modes (Primary, Secondary)
- Responsives: Desktop/Tablet/Mobile typography and frame widths

## Text styles (Poppins)
Header/H1–H4 | Title/T1–T5 | Body/B1–B8 | Caption/C1–C2 | Caption/Link Reg/Med

## Figma MCP workflow
1. Run get_design_context on selected node
2. Run get_variable_defs to get token names
3. Run get_screenshot for visual reference
4. Build using --pd-* token system
5. Validate against screenshot

## Component pages
Button, Button Group, Navigation Bar, Input Field, Text Area, Dropdown,
Accordion, Checkbox, Radio Button, Toggle, Avatar, Badges, Alerts,
Breadcrumb, Tab Bar, Divider, Modal, Carousel, Pagination, Tooltip,
Cards, Progress Bar, Slider, Table, Link
```

## Next session — start with this prompt

Paste this exactly at the start of your next chat or Claude Code session:

```
I'm sharing this context file to resume our Pandai DS work.
We decided to clean up the original DS file (TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f) 
to make it the standalone single source of truth for designers, 
front-end, and back-end developers. Please start the cleanup now.
```

### After cleanup — follow-up prompts

```
# Build documentation pages (run after component pages are organised)
"Build the Colors documentation page in the DS file showing all 
Atomic and Semantic color tokens as visual swatches with names and hex values"

"Build the Typography specimen page showing all 21 text styles with 
live text samples, font details, and token names"

"Build the Spacing & Layout page showing the full spacing scale and 
radius tokens as visual reference frames"

# Add component descriptions (run per page)
"Add descriptions to all component sets on the Button page explaining 
variants, states, sizes, and usage rules"

# Export tokens (run after cleanup is complete)
"Export all variables from the cleaned DS file as tokens.json 
following the W3C Design Tokens spec"

# Generate CLAUDE.md (run once file is published as library)
"Generate a complete CLAUDE.md for a React + TypeScript project using 
the Pandai DS with CSS Modules"
```
