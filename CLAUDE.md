## Claude Code — Design Development Rules

> These rules are **non-negotiable** and apply to every design implementation session.
> They are derived from explicit instructions + mistakes made during the modal development session (May 2026).

---

### 1. Always use the DS — never assume or generate

- Every component, token, color, spacing value, radius, icon, and asset **must come from the Pandai DS 1.5 file (`TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f`)**.
- Never guess, approximate, or invent any design value. If a value is unknown, use `get_design_context` or `use_figma` to pull it live from Figma before writing any code.
- Never create a custom component when a DS equivalent exists. Always check the component pages first.

**Mistake made:** Primary color was guessed as `#2FAC51`. Actual DS value is `#00cc85` (`Surface/primary/default`). `Text/default/heading` was assumed as dark navy `#0F172A` — actual value is `#404040`. `Text/primary/on-color` was assumed as pure white — actual value is `#e9fbf5`.

---

### 2. Always refer to Component Variants & States for interactions

- Every interactive state (**Default, Hover, Pressed/Active, Selected, Disabled, Focus**) is a distinct Figma variant with its own token bindings. **Do not approximate.**
- Pull each state's node via `get_design_context` separately. Never derive hover/pressed colors by manually darkening or lightening a default color.
- Transitions between states must use the exact token values from the DS variant, not CSS color manipulation.

**Mistake made:**
- Primary button hover was assumed to be a darker green. Actual DS: Primary hover transitions to the **Secondary palette** — `Surface/secondary/default` (`#b5f291`) bg, `Border/secondary/focus` (`#70bc6f`) border, `Text/secondary/focus` (`#70bc6f`) text.
- Secondary button Pressed state was not implemented. Actual DS: Secondary pressed **fills solid** — `Surface/primary/default` bg + `Text/primary/on-color` text.
- Disabled state was invented. Actual DS: `Surface/disabled/primary` (`#f2f2f2`) bg, `Border/disabled/disabled` (`#bfbfbf`) border, `Icon/disabled/default` (`#bfbfbf`) text.

---

### 3. Always use Semantic tokens for Radius, Padding, Gap, Spacing & Scaling

- **Never hardcode px values.** Every spatial value must resolve through a Semantic token.
- Token names must **mirror the Figma token path exactly** — no renaming, no abbreviations.
  - Figma path: `Surface/primary/default` → CSS variable: `--surface-primary-default`
- Layout padding must consistently use `Spacing/space-m` = **16px**.
- Layout gap must consistently use `Spacing/space-xs` = **8px**.
- Button radius is `Corner Radius/corner-rounded` = **60px** (pill) — not a standard radius step like `md` or `lg`.
- `Surface/general/default` is the correct Semantic name for white backgrounds — not `Surface/default`.

**Mistake made:**
- Button border-radius was set to `12px` — actual is `60px` pill shape.
- Button horizontal padding was set to `20px` — actual is `Spacing/space-s = 12px` for Size=L.
- Modal body padding was set to `24px` — must be `16px` (`Spacing/space-m`).
- Modal body gap was set to `16px` — must be `8px` (`Spacing/space-xs`).
- Footer padding was mixed `12px / 24px` — must be `16px` all sides.
- Invented tokens (`--surface-success-subtle`, `--pd-` prefix) instead of using actual Semantic token names.

---

### 4. Icons must always come from the DS Iconography page

- **Never write custom SVG paths or use third-party icon sets.** All icons must be sourced from the `🔰 Iconography` page in the DS file.
- Use `use_figma` to extract the exact vector paths from the icon node before implementing.
- Icons always render at their **DS native size (24×24)**. No scaling up or overriding with `width`/`height` in CSS.
- Icon containers must **hug content** — use `width: fit-content; height: fit-content; padding: <token>` — never a fixed pixel wrapper size.
- SVG `viewBox` must include a **1px buffer** on all sides (e.g., `viewBox="-1 -1 22 22"` for a 0–20 coordinate space) to prevent stroke clipping at path boundaries.

**SVG implementation pattern (confirmed correct — May 2026 navbar session):**
- Use a single hidden `<svg><defs>` block with `<symbol id="ic-*">` definitions for every icon.
- Reference icons via `<svg><use href="#ic-*"/></svg>` — never inline the paths repeatedly.
- All symbol paths use `stroke="currentColor"` so icon color inherits from parent CSS `color:` property.
- This enables state changes (hover/active/disabled) to cascade via a single `color:` rule on the container.

**Mistake made:**
- Used a hand-written `<polyline points="20 6 9 17 4 12"/>` checkmark instead of the DS `Outline/check-circle` (node `260:527`).
- Icon container was fixed `64×64` — must hug content.
- SVG was forced to `32×32` — DS native size is `24×24`.
- `viewBox="0 0 20 20"` clipped the 1.5px stroke at `x=20` / `y=-0.23` path edges — fixed to `viewBox="-1 -1 22 22"`.

---

### 5. Never use gradients — DS colors only

- **Gradients are strictly prohibited.** All colors must be flat values from the DS token system.
- Never use `linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, `conic-gradient`, or any CSS gradient function.
- All color values must resolve through Semantic tokens — no hardcoded hex values in rule declarations.

---

### 6. Never use drop shadows on cards or containers

- **Elevation/box-shadow is prohibited on cards, modals, and containers.**
- Cards and modal containers must use a `1px solid Border/primary/default` border for depth instead of shadow.
- The Elevation effect styles exist for reference only — do not apply them to UI containers in implementation.

**Mistake made:** Applied `box-shadow: Elevation/overlay` to the modal card. Corrected to `border: 1px solid var(--border-primary-default)` with no shadow.

---

### 7. Always use the correct component variant for the context

- Confirm which component variant applies before building. The DS has named variants for every use case.
- For two-button modal patterns: cancel/dismiss action → `Variants=Secondary` (outlined), confirm action → `Variants=Primary` (filled). `Variants=Tertiary` (ghost) is not appropriate for modal footers.

**Mistake made:** The Ignore button was implemented as `Variants=Tertiary` — actual correct variant is `Variants=Secondary` (white bg, green outline border, green text).

---

### 8. Icon clip framing is per-icon — never use blanket inset values

The DS renders each icon inside an `overflow:hidden` clip container using `position:absolute; inset: X%`. These percentages are **unique per icon** based on its internal geometry. Never apply a uniform default across all icons.

**Always pull the exact inset from `get_design_context` for the specific component node being implemented.**

**Confirmed inset values from DS node 866:5576 (Navbar 1.5, May 2026):**

Nav button icons — 20px clip container:
| Icon | DS inset |
|---|---|
| `Outline/home` | `8.33% 12.5%` |
| `Outline/check-circle` | `8.33%` |
| `Outline/battle` | `12.5%` |
| `Outline/book-open` | `12.5% 8.33%` |
| `Outline/users` | `12.5% 4.17%` |
| `Outline/book` | `8.33% 16.67%` |
| `Outline/star` | `8.33% 8.33% 12.42% 8.33%` |
| `Outline/gift` | `8.33%` |
| `Outline/chevron-down` | `37.5% 25%` |

Action icons — 24px clip container:
| Icon | DS inset |
|---|---|
| `Outline/search` | `12.5%` |
| `Outline/maximize` | `12.5%` |
| `Outline/smartphone` | `8.33% 20.83%` |
| `Outline/bell` | `8.33%` |
| `Outline/EN` | `top:25% right:9.95% bottom:28.12% left:12.5%` |
| `Outline/waffle-menu` | `16.67%` |

**Mistake made:** Applied blanket `8.33%` to all nav icons and `12.5%` to all action icons. Had to go back and add per-icon CSS overrides (`data-icon` attribute selectors) after pulling the actual DS values.

---

### 9. Spec context matters — always check the parent component, not standalone specs

A component's spec values can differ depending on where it appears. The same element (e.g., Pill Badge) has different typography when used standalone vs. embedded inside another component.

**Mistake made:** Pill Badge font-size was changed to `12px` based on the standalone Pill Badge DS spec — but inside Quiz Card the correct value is `10px` (`Body/B8`). Had to revert after fetching the actual Quiz Card node spec.

**Rule:** When implementing an element that appears inside a larger component, always `get_design_context` on the **parent component node**, not the standalone element node.

---

### Mandatory workflow before implementing any component

```
1. search_design_system  → confirm component exists in DS, get component key
2. use_figma             → find node ID across pages
3. get_design_context    → pull exact token bindings, dimensions, structure per variant
4. get_variable_defs     → confirm Semantic token names used on the node
5. Implement             → use only token values from steps 3–4, no assumptions
6. Validate              → compare against get_screenshot
```

## Project identity

- **Product:** Pandai — educational platform (Student / Teacher / Parent user roles)
- **Design tool:** Figma
- **AI assistant:** Claude Code (primary) + Claude.ai (planning/audit)
- **Workflow:** Figma MCP → Claude Code → VSCode → engineer handoff

## Figma file

| File | Key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Pandai DS 1.5 **(cleanup target)** | `TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f` | Original DS — single source of truth after cleanup |

---

## What was audited on the DS file (TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f)

### Critical issues found
1. **ALL_SCOPES on all 878 variables** — every variable had no scope restriction, polluting all property pickers
2. **All 20 component pages were empty** — components were scattered across Nadia Exploration, Syakila Components, and Zul's Dungeon pages
3. **Zero paint styles and zero effect styles**
4. **Semantic collection had colors only** — no spacing, radius, or typography semantic aliases
5. **Duplicate components across pages** — multiple versions of Button, Badges, Tab Menu with inconsistent naming

### What was working in the source
- 3-tier token architecture: Atomic → Product (per user role) → Semantic (Light/Dark)
- Product collection multi-mode aliases (Student/Teacher/Parent) pointing correctly into Atomic
- Zul's Dungeon had the most complete v1.5 component sets (44 sets, 23 standalones)
- Poppins type system was internally consistent

---

## Variable collections — actual state after Fix 1 + Fix 2

> **Note:** Actual collection names differ from earlier audit estimates. Counts below are from live file read.

#### Primitives (429 vars, 1 mode: Value) — formerly called "Atomic"
- Colors: Grey (50–950), Orange, Red, OG-Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Lime, Teal, Sky, Neon, Green, Slate, Foundation, Vanilla, Minion, Azure, Mustard, Subject/* palettes
- Scale/0–1k: spacing raw values (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 60, 108, 999)
- Corner Radius/xs–circle, pill, pill, lg, xxl, xxxl
- Typeface: Font Family, Font Weight, Font Size (50–900), Line Height (50–800)
- Border Width: xs, sm, md, lg
- Scopes fixed: colors → `FRAME_FILL SHAPE_FILL TEXT_FILL STROKE_COLOR EFFECT_COLOR`, Scale → `GAP WIDTH_HEIGHT PARAGRAPH_SPACING`, Radius → `CORNER_RADIUS`, Font Size → `FONT_SIZE`, Line Height → `LINE_HEIGHT`, Font Family → `FONT_FAMILY`, Font Weight → `FONT_STYLE`

#### Semantic (255 vars + 22 new = 277 vars, 2 modes: Light / Dark)
- Color groups: Text/*, Icon/*, Surface/*, Border/*, Overlay/* — scopes set per group
- **New float aliases added (Fix 2):**
  - `Spacing/component/none–2xl` → aliases into Primitives Scale/*
  - `Spacing/layout/sm–xl` → aliases into Primitives Scale/*
  - `Radius/none–full` → aliases into Primitives Corner Radius/*

#### Product (174 vars, 3 modes: Student / Teacher / Parent)
- Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (50–900), Success, Alert, Warning, Informative, Neutral
- Spacing/space-none → space-3xl, Border Width, Corner Radius, Overlay, Font/* tokens
- ALL_SCOPES removed — correct scopes assigned per type

#### Responsives (if present)
- Check file directly — not loaded during this session

### Text styles — 21 (Poppins)
```
Header/H1 (28px Bold) → Header/H4 (20px Medium)
Title/T1 (18px Bold) → Title/T5 (16px Medium)
Body/B1 (14px SemiBold) → Body/B8 (10px Medium)
Caption/C1 (12px Regular), Caption/C2 (10px Regular)
Caption/Link Reg (14px Regular), Caption/Link Med (14px Medium)
```

### Effect styles — 6
```
Elevation/xs → Elevation/sm → Elevation/md → Elevation/lg → Elevation/xl → Elevation/overlay
```

### Components — 431 across 25 pages
All from Zul's Dungeon. Full v1.5 coverage including:
- Button (3 sets: Button 1.5, Button Icon 1.5, Spinner 1.5)
- Button Group (2 sets: Parts + full group)
- Navigation Bar (7 sets + standalones: Navbar, Navbar Mobile, Learn Menu, Menu BG, etc.)
- Input Field (Input Field 1.5 + Input Group 1.5)
- Text Area, Dropdown (Parts + List + Tag), Accordion
- Checkbox, Radio Button, Toggle
- Avatar (Avatar 1.5 + Avatar Stacked 1.5)
- Badges (Pill + Subject + Label + Icon + Subject for Table)
- Alerts, Breadcrumb, Tab Bar (Parts + 1.5 + Var1)
- Divider, Modal (Alerts + Selection), Carousel (+ Parts)
- Pagination, Tooltip (+ BG Parts)

- Progress Bar, Slider (+ Progress Slider with Icon)
- Table (full set: Cell, Cell Parts, Body Cell/Row, Heading Cell/Row, Table 1.5, Column, Row, Slot, etc.)
- Link

**2 components NOT yet on their pages:**
- `Button - Dropdown - 1.5` → should go in **Dropdown** page
- `Quiz Card - 1.5` → should go in **Cards** page
- Fix: publish these in source library OR manually copy-paste into the correct pages

# Pandai Frontend — Claude Code Rules

## Files
Design system: https://www.figma.com/design/TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f

## Design system rules
- NEVER use hardcoded hex colors — use CSS variables: var(--pd-color-*)
- NEVER use hardcoded px spacing — use spacing tokens: var(--pd-spacing-*)
- NEVER create new components if a DS equivalent exists
- Always check /src/components before building new UI

## Token prefix
All exported CSS variables use prefix: --pd-

## Token collections
- Atomic: raw values (Foundation, Grey, OG Green, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Teal, Slate, Spacing, Radius)
- Semantic: aliased tokens with Light/Dark modes (Text, Surface, Border, Icon, Spacing, Radius)
- Product: role-based colors with Student/Teacher/Parent modes (Primary, Secondary)
- Responsives: Desktop/Tablet/Mobile typography and frame widths

## Text styles (Poppins)
Header/H1–H4 | Title/T1–T5 | Body/B1–B8 | Caption/C1–C2 | Caption/Link Reg/Med

## Figma MCP workflow
1. Run get_design_context on selected node
2. Run get_variable_defs to get token names
3. Run get_screenshot for visual reference
4. Build using --pd-* token system
5. Validate against screenshot

## Component pages
Button, Button Group, Navigation Bar, Input Field, Text Area, Dropdown,
Accordion, Checkbox, Radio Button, Toggle, Avatar, Badges, Alerts,
Breadcrumb, Tab Bar, Divider, Modal, Carousel, Pagination, Tooltip,
Cards, Progress Bar, Slider, Table, Link

## Next session — start with this prompt

Paste this exactly at the start of your next chat or Claude Code session:

```
I'm sharing this context file to resume our Pandai DS work.
We decided to clean up the original DS file (TLVKe3bgJTdVvuPAzgDq2f) 
to make it the standalone single source of truth for designers, 
front-end, and back-end developers. Please start the cleanup now.
```

### After cleanup — follow-up prompts

```
# Build documentation pages (run after component pages are organised)
"Build the Colors documentation page in the DS file showing all 
Atomic and Semantic color tokens as visual swatches with names and hex values"

"Build the Typography specimen page showing all 21 text styles with 
live text samples, font details, and token names"

"Build the Spacing & Layout page showing the full spacing scale and 
radius tokens as visual reference frames"

# Add component descriptions (run per page)
"Add descriptions to all component sets on the Button page explaining 
variants, states, sizes, and usage rules"

# Export tokens (run after cleanup is complete)
"Export all variables from the cleaned DS file as tokens.json 
following the W3C Design Tokens spec"

# Generate CLAUDE.md (run once file is published as library)
"Generate a complete CLAUDE.md for a React + TypeScript project using 
the Pandai DS with CSS Modules"
```

## HTML prototype — `zul.test.git/zul.home.screen.html`

Static HTML/CSS prototype of the Pandai home screen, implemented against DS 1.5.

**Architecture decisions:**
- Single `<svg><defs>` block at top of `<body>` holds all icon `<symbol>` definitions
- Icons referenced via `<use href="#ic-*">` — never inlined
- All icon colors via `color:` + `stroke="currentColor"` inheritance chain
- Per-icon clip insets via `data-icon` attribute selectors on clip containers
- All spacing, radius, and color values use CSS custom properties mapped to DS Semantic tokens
- No gradients, no box-shadows on containers — border only for depth

**Dev server (Windows):**
```powershell
# Start (bypasses PowerShell execution policy via cmd.exe)
Start-Process -FilePath "cmd.exe" -ArgumentList '/c', 'cd /d "<repo-path>" && npx serve . --listen 3000' -PassThru -WindowStyle Hidden

# Open in VS Code Simple Browser
Start-Process "vscode://vscode.simpleBrowser/show?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fzul.home.screen.html"
```
